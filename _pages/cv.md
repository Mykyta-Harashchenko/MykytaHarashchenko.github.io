## 📌 About Me

I’m a dedicated **Python Developer** with hands-on experience in backend development, web applications, and scalable systems.

My professional contributions include:
- Telegram bots for expense tracking
- Crowdfunding platforms with secure payment integrations
- Data scrapers powered by **BeautifulSoup**
- Backend optimizations and Dockerized deployment to **AWS**

I'm passionate about delivering clean, maintainable code that meets real-world needs while ensuring high availability, performance, and developer experience.
