Hi! I'm a passionate Python developer with experience building scalable web applications, APIs, and intelligent systems. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve developed a wide range of projects using **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **Telegram Bot APIs**, solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code.

My core strength lies in **backend development**, where I design robust APIs, manage databases, and ensure performance and security. I'm especially interested in **AI-driven applications** and have contributed to projects involving natural language processing, LLM prompting, and automation using machine learning techniques.

### ðŸ§  My Coding Principles

When writing code, I follow a set of principles that ensure the quality, clarity, and maintainability of my work:

- **Clean and Readable Code**  
  I write code that's easy to read and understand, not only for myself but for any teammate who might work with it in the future.

- **Efficiency and Simplicity**  
  I strive to solve problems with minimal complexity, using straightforward and efficient solutions whenever possible.

- **Modularity and Reusability**  
  I structure code into small, reusable components that are easy to test, extend, and maintain.

- **Testing and Reliability**  
  I believe in writing automated tests to catch bugs early and ensure long-term stability of the codebase.

- **Documentation**  
  Clear, concise documentation is essential to make sure others (and future me) understand how and why the code works.

- **Continuous Learning**  
  I constantly improve my skills and stay updated with best practices, new tools, and emerging technologies in the Python ecosystem.
